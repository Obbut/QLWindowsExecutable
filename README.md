A quick look generator for Windows executables (.exe files). It does not actually generate quick look windows but generates thumbnails, so Windows executables look like this in the Finder:

# Installing
QLWindowsExecutable needs `wrestool` from `icoutils`, which you can install with homebrew:

`brew install icoutils`

Then just place the generator in ~/Library/QuickLook and it should work.
